Model Checking of Warehouse Robotics
====================================

This repo contains the final project for the Computer Science and Engineering
Master's Degree course [*Formal Methods for Concurrent and Real-Time Systems*
(088882 - A.Y. 2020/21)][course] of Politecnico di Milano. The goal of the
project is to model the core entities of an automated warehouse and verify its
efficiency through the [UPPAAL][uppaal] modeling tool.

Both the [project assignment](assignment.pdf) and the
[final report document](uppaal_report.pdf) submitted for validation can be found in
the main folder.

Source code
-----------

The source code of the UPPAAL project (directly loadable into UPPAAL) submitted
for validation can be found in the file [`model_checking_warehouse_robotics.xml`](model_checking_warehouse_robotics.xml).
