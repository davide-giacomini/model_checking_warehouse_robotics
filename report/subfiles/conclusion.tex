\section{Conclusions}
In this report, we presented an analysis of the problem of the Model Checking of Warehouse Robotics. The scrutiny was focused on both realistic configurations and stressed configurations, in order to understand the validity of the representation of the system. To sum up, the model appears coherent with the specifications of the project and with abstract real-life situations.
